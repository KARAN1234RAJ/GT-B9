    <p>
      The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is
      adjacent to the first specified element and also the sibling of the first
      element.

      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
      readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
      as opposed to using 'Content here, content here'
